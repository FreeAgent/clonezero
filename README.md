# clonezero

This is a sample project for ClojureScript on Lambda, for a talk at [@clojureireland](http://twitter.com/clojureireland) on 7th Sept, 2016.

Slides from the talk: [A New Clone Army: ClojureScript on Lambda](http://bit.ly/2clRyGk).

The rest of this README is the default, generated by [cljs-lambda](https://github.com/nervous-systems/cljs-lambda).

## Deploying

Run `lein cljs-lambda default-iam-role` if you don't have yet have suitable
execution role to place in your project file.  This command will create an IAM
role under your default (or specified) AWS CLI profile, and modify your project
file to specify it as the execution default.

Otherwise, add an IAM role ARN under the function's `:role` key in the
`:functions` vector of your profile file, or in `:cljs-lambda` -> `:defaults` ->
`:role`.

Then:

```sh
$ lein cljs-lambda deploy
$ lein cljs-lambda invoke work-magic ...
```

## Testing

```sh
lein doo node clonezero-test
```

Doo is provided to avoid including code to set the process exit code after a
 test run.
